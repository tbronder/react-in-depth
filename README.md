# react-in-depth

Just a simple project for yours truly to learn some React (via Manning's [React in Depth](https://www.manning.com/books/react-in-depth)) and maybe a bit of golang for extra zhuzh. Development done in docker containers for easier portability inspired by Dave Bryant Copeland's [Sustainable Dev Environments with Docker and Bash](https://devbox.computer/).
